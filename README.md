# Quiz application

This is a small project of a quiz application made using 
ASP.NET Core as the back-end and React typescript as the
front-end.

Bootstrap and React MUI was used to give the application a
modern feel.

The database in the back-end uses EF Core In-Memory Database
so the data dissapears after each run of the application. 
Instead of controllers this project uses minimal-api for it's
simplicity.

To run it have Visual Studio 2022 and have the appropriate
packages installed and just run it.
If the page doesn't open automatically open the debug menu
and ctrl+click the https port that is shown.
